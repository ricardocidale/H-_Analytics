# Agent-Native Parity Map

Every UI action a user can take, Rebecca must be able to achieve through conversation.
This document is the canonical record of parity status. Update it whenever a new UI
feature ships or a new Rebecca tool is added.

**Status values:**
- ✅ Tool exists
- ⚠️ Gap — UI action has no Rebecca tool (must be resolved before merging UI feature)
- 🚫 N/A — user-only action or explicitly deferred
