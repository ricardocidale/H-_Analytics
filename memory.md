## Architecture Decisions Log

### Admin Replan v3 (April 2026)
- **Full replan document**: `.local/replan-admin-intelligence-v3.md`
- **Admin restructured to 5 groups**: Business, Intelligence Engine, AI Assistant, Design, System
- **ICP page removed**: Auto-derived portfolio profile replaces manual ICP (per research methodology)
- **Data Sources card system**: 4-column responsive grid for APIs, Scrapers, Sources, Models — each card = report card with health metrics, toggle on/off, configure, test, logs
- **Engine Dashboard**: Unified intelligence observatory replacing Coverage Analytics + System Intelligence + API Dashboard + Cache & Services
- **Intelligence freshness system**: Page-level green/amber/red status bar on Property + Company assumptions pages
- **Auto-staleness detection**: Key assumption changes (starRating, ADR, hospitalityType, businessModel, roomCount, location, revShares) mark research as stale
- **Auto-refresh**: If estimated research time < 30s, auto-regenerate; otherwise notify admin
- **Financial Lines page**: New admin page for viewing/approving engine-suggested calculation additions
- **Brand page**: Merge Logos + Themes + Icons into single page
- **Skills to create**: help-documentation, intelligence-freshness, data-source-cards
- **Skills to update**: admin-configurator, hbg-business-model, integrations-infrastructure
- **Implementation phases**: 5 phases, 28 tasks total

### Phase 1 Schema Changes (April 2026) — COMPLETED
- **businessModel field added** to properties table: `text("business_model").notNull().default("hotel")`
- **"vrbo" added to HOSPITALITY_TYPES** array + BUSINESS_MODEL_TYPES enum
- **lastAssumptionChangeAt** timestamp added to both `properties` and `global_assumptions` tables
- **BusinessModelSelector** component created in PropertyTypeSelector.tsx with Hotel/VRBO options
- **BasicInfoSection** updated with Business Model field + InfoTooltip
- **Auto-staleness detection** wired into property PATCH and global-assumptions PUT routes
  - Property triggers: starRating, startAdr, hospitalityType, businessModel, roomCount, city, stateProvince, country, revShareFB, revShareEvents, revShareOther, maxOccupancy, startOccupancy, adrGrowthRate
  - Company triggers: baseManagementFee, incentiveManagementFee, inflationRate, companyTaxRate, commissionRate, staffSalary, partnerCompYear1-10
- **Code review fix**: partnerComp1/2/3 → partnerCompYear1-10 (correct schema names)
- DB columns added via direct SQL (drizzle-kit push had stableKey constraint prompt)

### Phase 2 Admin Reorganization (April 2026) — COMPLETED
- **AdminSidebar restructured** to new 5-group layout:
  - Business: Users, Companies, Groups, Scenarios
  - Intelligence Engine: Engine Dashboard, Data Sources, Pipeline Config, QA Sandbox, Scheduled Research
  - AI Assistant: Configuration (Rebecca), Knowledge Base, Conversations
  - Design: Brand (merged Logos+Themes+Icons), Exports
  - System: App Defaults, Verification, Database, Notifications, Navigation
  - Logs: Activity (separate section at bottom)
- **Section redirects**: Old section IDs (icp, logos, themes, icons, llms, model-routing, cache-services, integrations, api-dashboard, coverage-analytics, pipeline-policies, source-registry, system-intelligence, research, sources) all redirect to their new locations via `resolveSection()`
- **New components created**:
  - `BrandTab.tsx` — sub-tabs for Logos, Themes, Icons
  - `EngineDashboard.tsx` — health bar + 4 stat cards + coverage heatmap + portfolio profile
  - `DataSourcesTab.tsx` — 4-column card grid (APIs/Scrapers/Sources/Models) with 15 seeded sources, toggle/configure/test/logs actions
  - `PipelineConfigTab.tsx` — sub-tabs for Pipeline Policies + Model Routing
  - `KnowledgeBaseTab.tsx` — wraps existing SourcesTab for Rebecca's training data
  - `ConversationsTab.tsx` — placeholder for chat history/analytics
- **No `adminIntelV2` feature flag dependency** — new sidebar always shows full structure
- **buildNavGroups()** no longer takes arguments
- Files: AdminSidebar.tsx, Admin.tsx, Layout.tsx, + 6 new component files

### Phase 3 Intelligence Freshness System (April 2026) — COMPLETED
- **IntelligenceStatusBar component** created: `client/src/components/intelligence/IntelligenceStatusBar.tsx`
  - 4 states: Current (green), Stale (amber), Missing (red), Running (blue pulse)
  - Unified `computeFreshnessStatus()` function — single source of truth for both the status bar AND the header dot indicators
  - Handles: research age > 7 days (stale), assumptions changed since last research (stale), no research (missing), actively generating (running)
  - Edge-case hardened: `safeTimestamp()` guard for invalid dates, `Math.max(0, ...)` clamp for future timestamps
  - Regenerate button appears on stale/missing states
- **PropertyEdit page** wired: Status bar below PageHeader, header dot uses `computeFreshnessStatus`
- **CompanyAssumptions page** wired: Status bar below PageHeader, header dot unified via `computeFreshnessStatus`
- **GlobalResponse type** updated: added `lastAssumptionChangeAt: string | null`
- All 3976 tests passing, 0 TS errors, lint clean, verification UNQUALIFIED

### Research Intelligence System (April 2026)
- **Research methodology skill created**: `.agents/skills/research-methodology/SKILL.md` — exhaustive 500+ line document covering STR chain scales, star ratings, revenue mix benchmarks, USALI expense ratios by segment, management fee structures, geography-driven cost adjustments, VRBO/STR business model, comp set selection criteria, and the full N+1 AI research pipeline
- **Key architectural decision**: Properties should auto-derive their research profile from existing assumptions — NO separate ICP definition needed per property. The property's own starRating + ADR + hospitalityType + location + revenue shares IS its research profile.
- **Business model variable**: `businessModel` field to be added to properties schema: "hotel" | "vrbo" (default: "hotel"). This determines which expense categories, revenue streams, fee structures, and research approaches apply.
- **Post-improvement principle**: Research must target the property's OPERATING state after improvements, not its acquisition state. If $2M in improvements add a pool and spa, research should target 4-star wellness boutique comps.
- **Equivalent STR tier derivation**: starRating + startAdr + hospitalityType → maps to Luxury/Upper Upscale/Upscale/Upper Midscale/Midscale
- **Tier-based default seeding**: New properties get defaults calibrated to their derived tier (see skill §8.1)

### Badge System (April 2026)
- All company-side badges wired: ManagementFeesSection (incentive fee), CompanySetupSection (inflation), PartnerCompSection (partner comp), FixedOverheadSection (business insurance)
- Key name mismatches fixed: travelPerClient→travelCost, itLicensePerClient→itLicense, miscOpsRate→miscOps, salesCommission→dispositionCommission, baseFee→baseManagementFee, incentiveFee→incentiveManagementFee
- ResearchBadge uses `accent-pop` (gold/amber) styling
- 42 PROPERTY_ASSUMPTION_KEYS + 22 COMPANY_ASSUMPTION_KEYS defined in schemas.ts

### Research Queue System (April 2026)
- Zustand store in `research-queue.ts`: concurrency 2, 429 retry with getState() fresh reads, reindex() position normalization, auto-prune after 15s
- ResearchLoadingOverlay: 3 variants (property, company, global), rotating tips, pulsing orb animation
- ResearchQueueIndicator mounted in Layout header
