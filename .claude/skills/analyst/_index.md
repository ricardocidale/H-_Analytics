# Skill: The Analyst

**Purpose:** Authoritative reference for any work touching The Analyst. Load this skill before editing anything in `engine/analyst/` (once Phase 2 lands), `engine/watchdog/`, `server/ai/`, `shared/analyst-conviction.ts`, or any UI file that renders Analyst output.

**Status:** Phase 1b landing — directive companions to the Phase 1a architecture docs under `docs/architecture/analyst/`.

## What The Analyst is (in one sentence)

The singular AI agent that delivers ranges, verdicts, and intelligence on every assumption surface in H+ Analytics — one voice to the user, a two-tier system in code.

## Two tiers — always keep these separate in your head

- **Surface tier** — a Specialist per UI surface (one Mgmt-Co tab, one Property tab, Admin Defaults, ICP, Cross-Portfolio, Staleness). Each returns a unified `AnalystVerdict`. This is what Phase 4 builds out.
- **Cognitive tier** — the existing three-model parallel synthesis pipeline (`server/ai/research-orchestrator.ts` + ~25 supporting files). Treated as stable foundation. Specialists call it via a typed façade when Tier-1 evaluation is warranted.

Between them sit the **Surface Router** (pure dispatch, no LLM) and the **Voice Renderer** (persona enforcement chokepoint). The user sees only The Analyst.

## Authoritative references (outside this skill)

| Reference | Role |
|---|---|
| `.claude/rules/the-analyst-persona.md` | **Non-negotiable.** The user-facing voice contract. Singular, capitalized, range-first, conviction-led. |
| `.claude/rules/analyst-team.md` | Internal vocabulary rule (Phase 1b). Resolves singular-voice vs team-naming tension. |
| `.claude/rules/analyst-verdict-contract.md` | Placeholder pointing forward to Phase 3 when `AnalystVerdict` lands. |
| `.claude/notes/analyst-architecture.md` | Claude Code's deep-dive on the Cognitive Engine. **The authority on the brain.** |
| `docs/architecture/ANALYST.md` | The architecture spine. Descriptive complement to this directive skill. |
| `docs/architecture/analyst/*.md` | Per-component specs — every skill file here has a sibling spec doc. |
| `docs/architecture/decisions/ADR-001-analyst-two-tier.md` | Why two tiers. |

## Reading order — new contributor to The Analyst

1. **`.claude/rules/the-analyst-persona.md`** — what The Analyst *is* to the user.
2. **`docs/architecture/ANALYST.md`** — the system shape (read the ASCII diagram).
3. **This `_index.md`** — the directive map.
4. **`.claude/rules/analyst-team.md`** — internal vocabulary.
5. **`steward.md`** (this dir) — the checklist you'll run every PR.
6. **`.claude/notes/analyst-architecture.md`** — the Cognitive Engine in depth.
7. **`orchestrator.md`** — how routing will work.
8. **The per-component spec for the surface you're about to touch** (`docs/architecture/analyst/<surface>.md` + this dir's matching skill file).
9. **`docs/architecture/decisions/ADR-001-analyst-two-tier.md`** — why the split exists.

Budget: ~2 hours the first time. 15 minutes to refresh on subsequent sessions.

## Invariants that bind everything in this skill

- **User-facing voice is always singular.** Never `"the analysts"`, `"our analysts"`, `"your analysts"`, or any other pluralization. Enforced by `tests/audit/vocabulary-compliance.test.ts`; Phase 3 adds runtime enforcement via Voice Renderer.
- **Specialists never craft user-facing strings.** They populate structured verdict fields; Voice Renderer produces the strings.
- **Specialists never import `research-orchestrator.ts` directly.** Go through the Cognitive Engine façade (`engine/analyst/cognitive/engine-client.ts` — Phase 2 stub, Phase 3 implementation).
- **Every Specialist returns `AnalystVerdict`** (once Phase 3 lands). Until then, `analyst-verdict-contract.md` defines the transition policy.
- **Every numeric verdict has a range.** Every range has a conviction level. No exceptions.
- **Every PR touching anything analyst-shaped runs the steward checklist** (`steward.md`).
