# Phase Status — Single Source of Truth

> **This file is the canonical live-status tracker** for every active workstream in the H+ Analytics codebase. Other docs (`replit.md`, ADRs, architecture docs, skill files) carry historical narrative and decisions but **do not** carry live phase-status tables. They point here.
>
> **Update rule:** When a phase status changes (Pending → In progress, In progress → Shipped, etc.), update this file in the same commit as the change. The CI guard at `npm run phases:check` fails if a duplicate status table appears outside this file.
>
> **Edit authority:** `.claude/**` is Claude Code's domain per `.claude/rules/claude-replit-split.md`. Replit Agent may update this file when shipping a phase, with a `Surfaces: phases-md` footer on the commit.

## Status legend

- ✅ **Shipped** — code merged to main, gates green, in production behavior.
- 🟢 **In progress** — packet open, work actively landing.
- ⏸ **Paused** — blocked on dependency or doctrine; not currently being worked.
- ⏳ **Pending** — next up, not yet started.
- 🟡 **Partial** — split phase; some sub-steps shipped, others pending (see notes).
- ❌ **Rejected** — was scoped, then dropped; kept for audit trail.
