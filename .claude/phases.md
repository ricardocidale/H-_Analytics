# Phase Status — Single Source of Truth

> **This file is the canonical live-status tracker** for every active workstream in the H+ Analytics codebase. Other docs (`replit.md`, ADRs, architecture docs, skill files) carry historical narrative and decisions but **do not** carry live phase-status tables. They point here.
>
> **Update rule:** When a phase status changes (Pending → In progress, In progress → Shipped, etc.), update this file in the same commit as the change. The CI guard at `npm run phases:check` fails if a duplicate status table appears outside this file.
>
> **Edit authority:** `.claude/**` is Claude Code's domain per `.claude/rules/claude-replit-split.md`. Replit Agent may update this file when shipping a phase, with a `Surfaces: phases-md` footer on the commit.

## Status legend

- ✅ **Shipped** — code merged to main, gates green, in production behavior.
- 🟢 **In progress** — packet open, work actively landing.
- ⏸ **Paused** — blocked on dependency or doctrine; not currently being worked.
- ⏳ **Pending** — next up, not yet started.
- 🟡 **Partial** — split phase; some sub-steps shipped, others pending (see notes).
- ❌ **Rejected** — was scoped, then dropped; kept for audit trail.

## Specialist Tier-1 Graduation (governed by ADR-007, Status: Accepted 2026-04-26)

> Path from current Tier-0 watchdog wrappers / unimplemented Specialists → Tier-1 N+1-driven Specialists meeting `.claude/rules/specialist-intelligence-bar.md`. Six phases, one Specialist per phase, sequential learning. Photos (F) and Resource Builder (L) are exempt; Constants Specialists (H–K) are a separate track. Owner = **CC** per `claude-replit-split.md` 2026-04-26 research/intelligence lane (engine code is CC; the route handler + UI surfacing slice is Replit's via two-track execution when applicable).

| Phase | Scope | Status | Owner | Commit/PR | Blocked-by | Next |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| G1 | Funding (A) graduation | ⏸ Paused | CC | `6f4696ba`, `71061c1d`, `8ba81dfd`, `9a461f92`, `ae2a16e7`, `e6f6059a` | ADR-004 Phase 5B v2 ✅ (24853904) | Engine code shipped; behavioral verification BLOCKED by Replit (`64701f7b`) — `verdict.meta` contract too thin. G1.5a ✅ + G1.5b-pre ✅ + G1.5b ✅ all closed; only G1.5c (Tier-1 deps wiring) remains before G1 closes. |
| G1.5a | ADR-008 verdict-meta extension (`fallbackReason`, `vendorsUsed`, `cacheState`) + Tier-0 fallback emission | ✅ Shipped | CC | `71ebbb9e` (S1) → `9e9036de` (S2) → `4ed92eb0` (S3) → `0ea2998f` (S4) → `da3f0afa`+`508b282d` (S5 collision) → `1f3a5323` (S6) → `fe15892f` (S7) | ADR-008 ✅ Accepted 2026-04-26 | All five gates green per S-step. Behavioral verification (Tier-0 half) testable in dev server now; Tier-1 half deferred to G1.5c. |
| G1.5b-pre | Trigger discipline remediation — drop save-tab Specialist dispatch + remove client auto-trigger hooks + new `tests/proof/analyst-trigger-discipline.test.ts` (16 tests) + Property page Analyst auto-trigger fix | ✅ Shipped | Replit | `c65d3ae0` (server-a) → `82a23cb8`+`d8a5183e`+`008612d4`+`cb82dc3c` (client-b, 4 commits) → `2267de88` (Task #739 Property page bonus) | G1.5a ✅ + analyst-trigger-discipline rule ✅ | All 5 gates green; proof test asserts no Specialist dispatch in save-tab + no auto-trigger in useEffect. Behavioral verification: Save returns data only; AnalystButton click is the only Analyst trigger. |
| G1.5b | Defaults & Assumptions cascade for 5 Funding fields (4 stored cols + `trancheGapMonths` derived from `capitalRaise1Date`/`capitalRaise2Date`) — schema columns + DEFAULT_* constants + model_defaults seed + Admin Steady-State UI + Funding-tab Assumption inputs + form-hook wiring + server-side Defaults overlay | ✅ Shipped | Replit | `c8881d38`+`6d00d805` (Packet A: schema + DEFAULT_* + Admin UI), `1bb965e2` (Packet B: 4 Funding inputs + form hook), `6e3f7bed` (Task #742: server overlay so user form inherits admin Defaults instead of falling through to hardcoded constants) | G1.5b-pre ✅ Shipped | Per `inflation-cascade.md` three-tier rule. Cascade: user assumption (formData) → admin Default (model_defaults via overlay) → hardcoded `DEFAULT_*` floor. `trancheGapMonths` is derived (no schema column) so the two date fields stay the single source of truth. |
| G1.5c | Tier-1 deps wiring — engine slice (a) + v1 cognitive ship (replaces b/c) | 🟡 Partial | CC | -a ✅ `58b03e88`+`f40e0d07`+`9d7fce86` | G1.5b-pre ✅ + G1.5a ✅ | -a (engine slice) ✅ shipped 2026-04-27. v1 active per `.claude/replit-handoffs/g1.5c-v1-funding-specialist.md` — single-shot Opus + careful prompt + rich context. Original b/c packets superseded after architectural decision (synthesis-schema gap). G1.5c closes when v1 ships + S6 prompt-review gate passes. AnalystButton click is the only trigger. |
| G2-v1 | Revenue (B) v1 — single-shot Opus + careful prompt + rich context | ⏳ Pending | CC | — | G1.5c ✅ (v1) + 1 session soak | Same v1 pattern as G1.5c-v1; `runRevenueSpecialist(...)` wires via `analyst-admin.ts` branch on `mgmt-co.revenue` scope. |
| G6-P2 | Funding Specialist N+1 panels — Gemini Flash quant + Sonnet market + Opus synthesis with convergence-score + vendor breadth ≥2 | ⏳ Pending | CC | — | G1.5c ✅ (v1) | Closes Intelligence Bar requirement #7 (vendor breadth) for funding. ~2 weeks after v1 ships. |

| G6-P4 | Funding Specialist Tier-1 fully graduated | ⏳ Pending | CC | — | G6-P3 ✅ | Intelligence Bar 9/9 satisfied. Closes the Tier-1 graduation arc for funding. |
