# H+ Analytics — Project Source of Truth

## What This Is

H+ Analytics is a hospitality-sector financial analytics platform. It lets asset managers model scenarios, run portfolio projections, and generate property-level slide decks. Users are organized by organization; access to scenarios and portfolios is governed by a share / permission model.

## Key Commands

```bash
pnpm run typecheck                              # full typecheck across all packages
pnpm run build                                 # typecheck + build all packages
pnpm --filter @workspace/api-spec run codegen  # regenerate API hooks + Zod schemas
pnpm --filter @workspace/db run push           # push DB schema changes (dev only)
```

## Architecture Notes

### Import discipline

- `lib/db/src/index.ts` initialises a `pg` Pool at module load. Frontend code **must** import schema from `@workspace/db/schema` (the subpath export), never from `@workspace/db` directly, to avoid pulling Node-only `pg` into the browser bundle.
- `lib/engine` follows this pattern correctly and is a reference.
- `artifacts/hospitality-business-portal/vite.config.ts` excludes `drizzle-orm/node-postgres`, `drizzle-orm/postgres-js`, `pg`, `postgres`, and `postgres-bytea` from `optimizeDeps`.

### Specialists

Specialists are **dev-defined only** — see `.claude/rules/specialists-are-dev-defined-only.md`. Admins are operators, not authors. No admin UI should expose specialist creation or editing.

### Roles and permissions

- `checker` and `investor` roles are still **live in the database** even though they have been removed from the `VALID_USER_ROLES` enum in code. Do not assume the enum is the full set of live roles.
- `canManageScenarios` is a boolean orthogonal to role — see the architecture audit at `.local/tasks/task-800.md`.
- Dual share tables exist: `scenario_access` (enforcement) and `scenario_shares` (admin tracking). Both must be kept in sync.

### Known issues to address

- **Email-existence leak** at `server/routes/scenarios.ts:466` — returns 404 "No user found with that email address", leaking whether an email exists. Should return a generic 404.
- DB audit (`.local/db-audit-phase-c-inventory.md`): 74 runtime migrations classified; 1 missing table (`cache_entries`), 17 missing indexes identified.
- `PROJECTION_YEARS` is exported from `lib/shared/src/constants.ts` as an alias of `DEFAULT_PROJECTION_YEARS`.

### Shared proxy routing

All traffic is routed by path through a shared reverse proxy. Services must handle their full base path. Never call service ports directly in application code or curl — always go through `localhost:80/<path>`.
