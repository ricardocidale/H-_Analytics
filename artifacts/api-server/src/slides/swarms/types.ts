 * Elisa / Felix) each implement `runTeam(input): Promise<SlideTeamOutput>`
 * via their respective `index.ts`. Members within a team follow the
 * Reader→Builder→Inspector triad with documented exceptions (Dario collapses
 * to 2, Felix expands to 5) per
 * docs/solutions/architecture-patterns/agent-native-precision-pipeline-pattern-2026-05-06.md.
 *
 * Identity strings (Name-NN form per CLAUDE.md §10) live in each member's
 * system prompt; filenames stay function-suffixed (reader.ts / builder.ts /
 * inspector.ts) per existing Lorenzo convention.
