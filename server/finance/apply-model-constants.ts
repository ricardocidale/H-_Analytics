/**
 * apply-model-constants — overlay admin-governed Model Constants onto the
 * GlobalInput before it reaches the financial engine.
 *
 * This is the single boundary where rows in `model_constant_overrides`
 * (and the canonical `model_constants` table) become numbers the engine
 * actually uses. Without this overlay, an admin's Regenerate-via-Analyst
 * or manual override on (e.g.) `daysPerMonth` would be saved but ignored
 * by every projection.
 *
 * Scope:
 *   - Universal Model Constants (locality === "universal") are overlaid
 *     on the global object directly. `daysPerMonth` is the only one
 *     today.
 *   - Country-keyed constants overlaid here for the global jurisdiction
 *     baseline (United States today): `depreciationYears`. Per-property
 *     overrides still win the engine cascade
 *     (`property.X ?? global.X ?? CONSTANT`); the overlay only changes
 *     what `global.X` resolves to.
 *   - Other country / country+state constants (`inflationRate`,
 *     `costRateTaxes`, `taxRate`, `countryRiskPremium`,
 *     `capitalGainsRate`) are NOT yet overlaid here — moving them into
 *     the overlay requires backfilling existing globalAssumptions
 *     deviations into manual overrides so behavior is preserved. Tracked
 *     as a follow-up; see
 *     `docs/audits/task-379-defaults-vs-source-of-truth.md`.
 *
 * Server-side authoritative override: the value coming in on the request
 * body (from the client's local copy of globalAssumptions) is replaced
 * by the admin-governed value. The admin's override always wins, even if
 * a stale client sends a different number.
